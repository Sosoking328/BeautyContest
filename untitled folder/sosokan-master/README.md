We have buddybuild setup, so simply commit your change to the master branch and it will send out a build.

[![BuddyBuild](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/statusImage?appID=56f6f4cfac2d7a01000e452d&branch=master&build=latest)](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/56f6f4cfac2d7a01000e452d/build/latest)

Our slack channels are #github, #buddybuild and #heroku - they show the notifications for the project.
